# PALINDROME FINDER

## Description
This Java program is designed to identify palindromes. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

## Features
- **User input handling**: Uses the `Scanner` class to take input from the user.
- **Continuous input loop**: Employs a `while` loop to continuously prompt for user input until 'q' is entered to quit.
- **String reversal**: Implements `StringBuilder` for efficient string reversal.
- **Case-insensitive comparison**: Uses `equalsIgnoreCase` method to compare the original word and its reversed version, ignoring case differences.
- **Conditional responses**: Includes `if-else` statements to provide appropriate responses based on whether the input is a palindrome or not.

## Installation
No specific installation is required. Just ensure you have a Java runtime environment to execute the program.

## Usage
1. **Compile and run the program**: Compile the `palindromeFinder.java` file and run it.
2. **Enter a word**: When prompted, enter a word to check if it is a palindrome.
3. **View the result**: The program will display whether the entered word is a palindrome or not.
4. **Continue or quit**: To test another word, repeat step 2. To quit, type 'q' and press enter.
